# PySpark Stock Analysis Application
This project involves analyzing stock market data using PySpark to handle large datasets efficiently and perform comprehensive data analysis.

## Project Overview
The stock market generates vast amounts of data daily, making it essential to use scalable tools for analysis. This project leverages PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework, to process and analyze stock data, providing insights into market trends and stock performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical stock prices and related financial metrics. Key features typically are:

• Date: The trading date.

• Open: Opening price of the stock.

• High: Highest price during the trading session.

• Low: Lowest price during the trading session.

• Close: Closing price of the stock.

• Volume: Number of shares traded.

## Methodology
The analysis is structured as follows:

### Data exploration:

• Dataset schema.

• Information for each column.

• Number of missing values.

• Correlation matrix.

### Feature Engineering:

• Creating average values calculations for different durations.

• Creating moving averages to identify trends.

• Calculating daily returns and cumulative returns.


## Results
The analysis provides insights about the identification of trends and patterns in the stock prices.

Detailed findings and visualizations are available in the project notebook.
